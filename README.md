# ⚡ Antigravity Skills

> **Precision Engineered Capabilities for Google AI Pro Ecosystem**

Welcome to the official repository of **Antigravity Skills**.
This library hosts specialized, deterministic, and rigorously tested "skills" (instruction sets) for AI agents operating within the Google Antigravity and Gemini ecosystem.

## 🛡️ Philosophy: "Zero Hallucination"

Unlike generic skill libraries, Antigravity Skills are built with a **Clean Room** methodology:

1.  **Written from Scratch:** No copy-pasting. Every line is intentional.
2.  **Google-First:** Optimized for Gemini Pro 1.5 context windows and GCP infrastructure.
3.  **Deterministic:** Logic over creativity.

## 📦 Core Skills

### `skill-forge` (The Meta-Skill)

The manufacturing plant for all other skills. Use this skill to creating new capabilities ensuring they meet the **Antigravity Standard**.

## 🚀 Installation

This repository is designed to be the "Source of Truth".
To use these skills in your project:

1.  **Clone this repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourOrg/antigravity-skills.git ~/antigravity-skills
    ```

2.  **Link or Copy to your project:**
